# Teltonika-Notes

## General Notes
(in this author's view) Teltonika routers represent a great mix of features/value/ease-of-use and availability. Many models can be had from Mouser and Digi Key, while having very reasonable price points.  
Unlike many other embedded routers, they feature to ability to be Wireguard VPN peers. They can also do this without any command-line hacking (looking at you Ubiquiti).
